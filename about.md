# About me

I am a motivated learner with a great passion for Data Analytics and Machine Learning fields. I am interested in solving business challenges using my analytical skills and leveraging machine learning in order to help organizations by giving them thoughtful insights for their decision making. 

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist in NeenOpal Inc. I am working for clients across various domains. I analyzed monthly performance of Marketing and Recovery officers of a leading NBFI in Sri Lanka and scored them based on their performance. I also built hybrid models in order to predict the sales at store and SKU level(500+ stores and 1000+ SKUs) for one of the largest Tiles producers in Sri Lanka. Other tasks involve with making dashboards to help the clients to quickly gain insights into the most important aspects of their data. I write lots of SQL queries and Python scripts in my work.

I obtained a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Information Technology - Jabalpur ([IIITDMJ](https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}). During my undergraduation, I (along with my friend) [designed](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/projects/fpgacnn/){:target="_blank"} a CNN accelerator on Intel Cyclone V SoC FPGA. At some other point during my undergraduation, I did a Research Internship at the Human Computer Interaction lab (HCI), Indian Institute of Information Technology - Allahabad, where I was supervised by [Prof. Anupam Agrawal](https://it.iiita.ac.in/?pg=facultypage&uid=anupam){:target="_blank"}.


I am broadly interested in working in settings where clean data is scarce but raw and dirty data is abundant. In the past, I have worked on analyzing large amounts of raw data to generate useful insights and built predictive models. Apart from this, machine learning for audio, sequential data and edge ML fascinates me.
